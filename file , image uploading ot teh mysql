troble_shooting teh issues:

..> In SQL, you must use forward slashes / instead of backslashes \.

--> SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile';
If it shows:

Variable_name	Value
local_infile	OFF
then you must turn it ON.

ðŸ‘‰ Turn it ON like this:

SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;
(You may need root user to run this.)




NOTE: 
Even if secure_file_priv is empty,
still MySQL must have permission to access your Desktop files.
ðŸ‘‰ So make sure the file permissions allow reading.

If you get NULL after inserting, possible reasons could be:

Wrong path (make sure / slashes are correct, not \).

File is locked or not readable by MySQL.

File name is wrong (check file extensions like .pdf, .jpg).

ðŸ›  How to check exactly?
After running:

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv';
You should see something like:


Variable_name	Value
secure_file_priv	(empty)
Then no restriction. You are free to use Desktop files.


What is BLOB? 

.> BLOB = Binary Large Object.
.> It is how MySQL stores files (like images, PDFs, etc.) inside the database.
.> You cannot directly see the file inside Workbench visually â€” you will see something like [BLOB], or a long hex value (0xFFD8...).



EXAMPLE CODE HERE:
======================= >

create table ff(
-- id int primary key,
-- file longblob,
-- pic longblob
-- );
-- show tables;
-- desc ff;

-- select * from ff;
-- INSERT INTO ff VALUES (
--   2,
--   LOAD_FILE('C:/Users/Sachin/OneDrive/Desktop/mental.png'),
--   LOAD_FILE('C:/Users/Sachin/OneDrive/Desktop/dummy-pdf.pdf')
-- );




Example full flow (easy to understand)
âœ… Upload a photo into database:

INSERT INTO ff (photo)
VALUES (LOAD_FILE('C:/uploads/myphoto.jpg'));

âœ… Download that photo from database:
SELECT photo
INTO DUMPFILE 'C:/Users/Sachin/Desktop/downloadedphoto.jpg'
FROM ff
WHERE id = 1;

âœ… Check if local_infile is ON:
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile';\

âœ… Check allowed folder for file operations:
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv';

âœ… If file is big (>1MB), check:
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_allowed_packet';
(If too small, increase it.)






Important Functions for File Uploads in MySQL

Function Name	Purpose	Example
LOAD_FILE()	Reads a file from disk and returns its binary content	LOAD_FILE('C:/uploads/sample.pdf')
HEX()	Converts binary (BLOB) to hex string (for viewing)	SELECT HEX(photo) FROM ff;
UNHEX()	Converts hex back to binary (for inserting)	INSERT INTO ff (photo) VALUES (UNHEX('FFD8FFE0...'));
SELECT INTO DUMPFILE	Writes a file to disk from database BLOB	SELECT file INTO DUMPFILE 'C:/uploads/newfile.pdf' FROM ff WHERE id=1;
