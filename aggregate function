AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS IN MYSQL :
------------------------------------>

DEFINE : aggregate functions in MySQL are used to perform calculations on multiple rows of data and return a single value:




1) AVG(): Calculates the average value of a numeric column.
Example: SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;

2) COUNT(): Counts the number of rows in a result set.
Example: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;

3) SUM(): Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
Example: SELECT SUM(price) FROM products;

4) MAX(): Returns the maximum value in a column.
Example: SELECT MAX(age) FROM students;

5) MIN(): Returns the minimum value in a column.
Example: SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;

6) COUNT( DISTINCT <COLUMN_NAME> ) : COUNTS ONLY THE NON-SPECIFIED VALUES:


COUNT(*): Counts all rows in the result set, including rows with NULL values.
COUNT(column_name): Counts the number of rows where the specified column_name has a non-NULL value.
COUNT(DISTINCT column_name): Counts the number of distinct non-NULL values in the specified column_name.

..> COUNT(*): Counts all rows in the result set, including rows with NULL values.
COUNT(column_name): Counts the number of rows where the specified column_name has a non-NULL value.
COUNT(DISTINCT column_name): Counts the number of distinct non-NULL values in the specified column_name.

7) GROUP_CONCAT(): Concatenates values from a group into a single string.

Example: SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(name) FROM employees;


SYNTAX:
SELECT student_name,
         GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT test_score
                      ORDER BY test_score DESC SEPARATOR ' ')
       FROM student
       GROUP BY student_name;

ex:
select CustomerID ,group_concat(product) as products_ordered from orders  group by CustomerID;

select CustomerID ,group_concat(product separator '-') as products_ordered from orders  group by CustomerID;

select CustomerID ,group_concat(product order by product asc separator '-') as products_ordered from orders  group by CustomerID;




| CustomerID | ProductsOrdered                               |
